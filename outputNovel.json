His *ss would\u2019ve gotten killed years ago.\nIf you can get past the fact the mc is basically an egotistical teenager with no character development yet, the rest of the novel is enjoyable.", "I can\u2019t get over his personality. He literally attacks people and when they defend themselves he says \u201cmy life is so precious how dare he try to take it from me\u201d", "Well I would argue that isn\u2019t actually as bad as some other actions he takes as most gangsters use self-justification as a way to cope with the crimes they commit.

The guy is an *ssh*l* for the sake of being an *ssh*l*\nThe novel is also full of cliches\nDont worry pal, when you read a good novel you will see that this is one is \"fun\", but not good", "Both of you do get that this is supposed to be a Medieval Romance Fantasy in that sense it does haves nearly all the elements to make it perfect... While it is Full Of cliches What the heck else type of Plot twist do u expect from it. The story is doing what its supposed to do... And as for \"that I havent read 'Good' novels\" I had a Library which exceeded 50+ Novels just on this site. I have read alot of Novels for the past 2 years... I have been through more novels than most ppl on this site. All of them have their Good points and Bad Points but hardly enough the story actually fulfills the type of setting its set in This ones actually does that.", "If this is a list for your perfect novel, I can honestly say you haven't read even one decent novel.\nIf anything this novel has every cliche possible from every novel from every genre.", "Your giving the benefit of the doubt here. Some people even after experiencing good stories still praise mediocre titles, I guess it depends on how 'lenient' you are with a story, cause personally I find 99% of 'good' stories as mediocre.

And this happens multiple times.", "You enjoying the league man?", "Yea it kinda feels like the whole gangster thing dropped without any major reason in the story but rest of it is pretty good", "Good, as that was going nowhere", "Dropping/shielfing it for now,read the first 9 chapters and can't seem to get with MCs personality and brashness,prob just a preference thing ion know\ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "It's nice, although the focus on magic seems to waiver.

Leading one problems to another without changing pace(ngl kinda mentally exhausting) The pace is so slow with repetitive plots that it's kinda suffocating and hard to bear.

I don't want to spoil anything. but for me, the story starts getting good around chp17-ish. before that, you can treat it as soft infodump/knowing several characters more before you can kinda feel the story start to move more progressively.", "Just so all you fellow readers know. This novel is very slow paced and author takes his time with it and the chapters are also considerably small so if you are thinking to pick this up then keep it in mind.

Lazy writing I already don't like where it's going", "Read the next chapter and you'll know why", "I understand thr author says he made them months ago that's not the point. The point is that the author just makes mc has gun out of no where's and then write it that he had them for months it's lazy it's like author forgot gun existed and made no preparation for mc to have guns just wrote them into existence in a instant. Author can remember to describe mc's mother and sister breast but forget to add a plot of making or even mentioning guns.", "He tried to make guns before by hiring his local blacksmith to work on the part. He was a Mafia member so he knew how to assemble a gun. He didn't reveal that he had them because he tested them against beasts, and it wasn't very effective, so he scrapped that idea.

The action in Volume 2 really picks up from chapter 188 to the end of volume 2 (chapter 235). While not as exhilarating (overall) as Volume 1, Volume 2 is still good and provides lots of information as this is required for Volumes 3 and 4 to reach the same level of excitement, engagement and world building as Volume 1. You would immediately observe that Volume 3 continues in the same vein/mould as Volume 1 (i.e. observing the perspectives of the other \u201cmain\u201d characters, progression of multiple aspects of the plot, plotting, scheming and the development of other characters\u2019 powers).\nGiven where you are in the story, I think you will soon reach points of great excitement again.", "But where's the genderbender tag?", "Author forget to put it", "?...", "minor spoiler", "I am writing this comment on behalf of the author.
