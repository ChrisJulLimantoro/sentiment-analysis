rating, so I read it. Long story short, keep it BELOW 4. It is bad. The worst aspect is the writing, not grammer, not diction, the writing itself. How the author writes about the world, the story itself, its just bad.\\nIts your generic MC is special but most folks don't know, the big strong people find out. Its nothing special, he even gets a special pet early on.\\nIts so forced, the entire novel is just PLOT ARMOR. It has no rhyme or reason. We have MC finding legendary stuff because of an A rank thing. How does this world even function?\\nWhat really grinded by gears was a simple thing. I can ignore how the child MC acts like a child. But why is the author using percentages for a concrete number. We know X amount of people are inside, don't use a percentage for how many advanced, and of those how many advanced further, and of those how many died.

He'll get them on his return.\", 'Yes', 'For anyone wondering if they should read this , do it . Those reviews were probably rushed or from some stupid readers (some were complaining there’s no character development on the 9th chapter). The novel starts off a bit slow thats because the author wants to expand the world and the story of the MC later on so we basically still dont know whats he gonna do or who’s he gonna go against . Personally i like this type of novels .\\nIt might not be the best but its definitely not a waste of time .', \"Gotta agree with you there. Even if I don't think the novel is perfect, 3.5 is still too low.\", \"Should I consider reading this novel?

This only applies to Western authors,', \"It feels noticeable and odd to me because I imprinted long ago on paperback Western fantasy novels where authors often make up names like Anahurtok or use names with a long history like Rhiannon. Overall, they have a certain aesthetic. When I read web novel book descriptions with characters named Kyle, it kinda lands on me the same as if they did name the character Bob Smith. It's like a mental sad trombone sound.\\nThis incidentally is also why I hate when translations change people's Chinese names to things like Jim and Sara.\", 'Na bro', \"best I can say this novel is a joy to read sometimes the Mc acts dumb and life just constantly tries to screw him over he always finds a way to twist the situation in his favor my one complaint is how he behaves he behaves like a tough outside soft inside which I like but we don't get to see his gangster side except with his glare but don't expect fighting or murder or even cheating he's as fair as they come\", 'Ping me when it has 500+ chapters', 'The profile picture is kind of ...

Roller-coaster of good-bad-good, bad-good. Mc isn't genius, only borderline above average. There's not much character development until now, wven in the MC. The system is kinda mehh... Also, simple solution doesn't happen here, it's faceslapping and coincidences sometimes.\\nNow, the performances are amazing, one of a kind. The author writes very well these moments and you can feel the excitement and emotions. Basically you keep reading for the heartwarming moments and performances until the end of the first arc, if I can say like this. How it will be after this? I hope it gets better.\", 'I think, rather than coincidences the system feels like it knows what will happen in the future that’s why it’s preparing the mc for that moment with missions to help him. More like, the missions are hints of what will happen that’s why it seems like there are so many coincidences happening.', \"The best way to describe this novel is thus. The author struggles a lot with the drama. But when he does sh*t right g*dd*mn he does sh*t right. Specifically every single time they've gone onto stage to perform haa been super emotion. Hopefully the drama does improve. If it does become good, then this novel could be an easy 10/10.

Some of the plot and conflicts are so forced it\\'s almost pathetic and makes you wonder how the main character was even a gangster. Sometimes the author makes him really smart and another time, he\\'s as naive as a 5 year old. It\\'s so frustrating reading those forced plot because of how easy it could have been solved but the author just has to dumb down the main character to \"deepen the conflict/plot\" completely unnecessary if you ask me.\\nHowever aside from that, it\\'s good for causal reading.', 'I read till chapter 83.its a bit boring but alright till now.\\nCan i get any recommendations on other novels with tower and leveling which are better than this one.', 'Leveling with the gods is good up until the TL changes and it goes to absolute sh*t, the tutorial is too hard is an absolute masterpiece (the novel, the manhwa is trash) but with a subpar translation, and second life ranker is great.', \"Leveling with the gods might be more your style.

If u guys don't have anything to read, try read this. Just read it for fun and don't dwell too much on the power level since this novel main genre isnt action.\\nIf you looked at the reviews, despite the decent rating (mostly 4 & 5 stars), there is also a lot of dislikes on those comments, most probably due to the harem and as someone who didn't like harem, this novel is fine, not bad since the heroines are not blatantly try to compete with each other.\\nMC is ok, not an emo chunni but someone that is quite mature and smart. If you like character like Cale Henituse from LOCF, then you will like Carl(MC) too.\\nHe is indeed quite dense but not too much since his EQ is normal. He can be considered OP but just like I said, the power level wasn't explained in detail so his OPness wasn't showed much so far.\", 'Mr. HadesinHeaven, could you please either introduce me a similar story to TCF or this story OR a story with a MC similar character to Cale or Carl?', \"Hmm Cale's character is kinda unique so it kinda hard to suggest.

He have a very bad bad past. But unlike Cale, mc here really gave up everything until he became indifferent to anything except his mother. It's a Reincarnation novel.\\n•The Editor is the Novel's Extra\\n•Solo Bug Player (manhwa) - MC transmigrated in a game, but he also happened to be pretty crazy about this game, basically created his world's version of a Wikipedia page with pretty much everything in the game included.\\n•Trash of a Fantasy Novel/ Trapped in A Webnovel as a good for nothing (manhwa) - MC transmigrated into a novel, and he, like Cale, was the novel's villain. He's more hands-on than Cale though, because the original owner of his new body 'befriended' the protagonist, who is NOT a nice guy.\", \"Thank you for your recommendations.
